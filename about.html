        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
            My tertiary education was completed at the Durban University of technology, where I obtained my Diploma in Analytical Chemistry in 2020. My courses were mainly chemistry orientated with courses such as; inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry as well as, electroanalytical chemistry. I am also currently doing an online course with Freecodecamp.org as well as Codecademy that helps me with my web development,cyber security and coding training.

        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>
            I currently have 2 year of experience within a commercial, manufacturing laboratory setting, where I completed multiple routine and non-routine analysis to analysis a plethora of samples from water to soil, fertilizers, sugar and even animal feed. I am well-versed with a multitude of instrumentation and a variety of analytical methods. I have also worked in production lab where I worked with polymers as well as deformers. I am aquianted with working shift work and working night shift where I was part of the quality team. Currently I am working in a manufacturing lab that produces paints, primers and coating solutions. I will enroll in a quality management system course, that will help me further my quality and chemistry knowledge. I have multiple test and practice websites that showcase my knowledge of both HTML and CSS.
